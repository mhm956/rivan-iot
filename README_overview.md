## RIVAN (Remote IoT Vulnerability Alert Network)

The goal of the RIVAN network is to provide administrators and developers of distributed IoT systems a system of tools
remotely monitor the current vulnerabilities found in their network. The RIVAN system consists of multiple simulated 
networks which simulate possible real-world vulnerability logs. These logs are collected into a centralized platform
which allows analytics and real-time alerts to the monitoring system administrators. The backend uses a scalable,
offsite-hosted approach allowing administrators to scale the number of networks monitored by scaling the backend 
resources linearly.

The RIVAN network is built on the "Google Cloud" platform and utilizes <Add techs here>
